🎮 Number Guessing Game
✅ Task Description
Build a Number Guessing Game in Java as part of CodSoft Internship Task 1.

Requirements:
Generate a random number between 1 to 100.

Prompt the user to guess the number.

Provide hints if the guess is too high or too low.

Limit the user to 10 attempts.

Ask if the user wants to play again after each game.

Display appropriate end messages and results.

💻 How it works
The program generates a random number using Java’s Random class.

It prompts the user to guess using Scanner.

After each guess:

If the guess is too low, it prints “It is higher”.

If the guess is too high, it prints “It is lower”.

If the guess is correct, it prints “You have guessed the correct number within X tries.”

The user has a maximum of 10 attempts to guess.

If all attempts are used without a correct guess, it reveals the actual number.

At the end of each game, the user is asked:

“Do you want to play again? (yes/no)”

If yes ➔ The game restarts with a new number.

If no ➔ The game ends with a thank you message.
